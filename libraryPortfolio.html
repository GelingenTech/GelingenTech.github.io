        <h1>Library</h1>
        <p>
            Library is a project made in C# that acts as a library homepage. Users are able to view, search, check in, and check out books from the Library. The program consists of three separate files; one main, a file to define Book, and a file that defines names.
        </p>
        <div class="images">

	    <p>This is a code snippet from the main file of the program. This file housed Main, and was in charge of handling inputs and initializing the list of books. This snippet in particular features a method to search for a book by its author. It does thus by comparing the first and last names of the author to the query.</p>
            <img src="library2.png" alt="Image 2">
<p>The Book class is in charge of the book constructor. The code snippet contains the constructor as well as the string override for books.</p>
            <img src="library3.png" alt="Image 3">
<p>The Name class is almost the same as the Book class but this one checks for input validation as the Name is being constructed.
